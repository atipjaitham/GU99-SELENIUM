# Automated Testing with Selenium and Pytest

This project aims to provide hands-on experience in automated testing within a simulated corporate environment. Test cases are automated using Selenium for a demo banking website. Additionally, participants have the opportunity to compare their automation scripts with sample scripts created by experts in real-time.

## Project Overview

In this project, participants will:

- Create and execute automation scripts using Selenium with Python.
- Practice parameterizing scripts using Excel files.
- Utilize Pytest as a testing framework instead of TestNG.
- Learn to capture screenshots of test output and integrate verification steps into their scripts.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants will gain proficiency in:

- Creating WebDriver test scripts for a sample banking application.
- Parameterizing scripts using Excel spreadsheets.
- Using Pytest as a testing framework.
- Capturing screenshots of test output and integrating verification steps into their scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, participants should have:

- Basic knowledge of the Python programming language.
- Understanding of web concepts and HTML/CSS.
- Familiarity with Selenium WebDriver.
- Experience with the Pytest framework (optional).
